# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

You will use Express to handle routing and mySQL to read and write data. Make sure you deploy your app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.

### Before You Begin

- Check out [this demo version of the site](https://friend-finder-fsf.herokuapp.com/). Use this as a model for how we expect your assignment look and operate.

- Create a folder called `FriendFinder`. Inside the folder, organize your directories so it matches the following:

  ```
  FriendFinder
    - .gitignore
    - app
      - public
        - home.html
        - survey.html
      - routing
        - apiRoutes.js
        - htmlRoutes.js
    - node_modules
    - package.json
    - server.js
  ```

### Submission on BCS

- Please submit both the deployed Heroku link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

### Instructions

1. Your survey should have 10 questions of your choosing. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

2. Your `server.js` file should require the basic npm packages we've used in class: `express` and `path`.

3. Your `htmlRoutes.js` file should include two routes:

   - A GET Route to `/survey` which should display the survey page.
   - A default, catch-all route that leads to `home.html` which displays the home page.

4. Your `apiRoutes.js` file should contain two routes:

   - A GET route with the url `/api/friends`. This will be used to display a JSON of all possible friends.
   - A POST routes `/api/friends`. This will be used to handle incoming survey results. This route will also be used to handle the compatibility logic.

5. In addition to the two routes, your apiRoutes.js file will included a connection to your database and the required logic to read and write data. Be sure to require the 'mysql' npm package!
   Be sure to reference the MySQLHerokuDeploymentProcess.pdf file guidance in setting up your database to work on heroku, but your connection will look something like this:

```
  var connection;
  if (process.env.JAWSDB_URL) {
  connection = mysql.createConnection(process.env.JAWSDB_URL);
  } else {
  var connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host: "localhost",
    port: 3306,
    user: "root",
    password: "YOURPASSWORD",
    database: "YOURDBNAME"
  });
  }

  connection.connect(function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error("error connecting: " + err.stack);
    //once successfully connected, you may want to query your database for the info you'll need later!
  }
  });
```

6. Create tables and seed your database with a few 'profiles'to start
   -You'll have one simple table that looks like so:

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS profiles (
   name VARCHAR(25),
   photo VARCHAR(255),
   scores VARCHAR(25)
);

```

7. Your 'scores' data will be saved as a string of numbers, seperated by comma's, but after being queried, will ultimately have to look like this:

```
  {
    "name": "Ahmed",
    "photo": "https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/6/005/064/1bd/3435aa3.jpg",
    "scores": [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]
  }
```

That will look something like this:

```
  function loadProfiles() {
  // Selects all of the data from the MySQL profiles table
  connection.query("SELECT * FROM profiles", function(err, res) {
    if (err) throw err;
    //a fun trick for converting mysql's returned 'rowPacketData' obj into more usable JSON
    var data = JSON.stringify(res);
    data = JSON.parse(data);
    // loop over your data converting the string of numbers into an array (using split??)
    friends = data;
  });
}
```

8. Determine the user's most compatible friend using the following as a guide:

   - Convert each user's results into a simple array of numbers (ex: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`).
   - With that done, compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users, question by question. Add up the differences to calculate the `totalDifference`.
     - Example:
       - User 1: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
       - User 2: `[3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
       - Total Difference: **2 + 1 + 2 =** **_5_**
   - Remember to use the absolute value of the differences. Put another way: no negative solutions! Your app should calculate both `5-3` and `3-5` as `2`, and so on.
   - The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.

9. Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, display the result as a modal pop-up.

   - The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.

10. Be sure to write the submitted user data back to the database. Remember to first turn your array of scores back into a string of comma seperated numbers. (join!)

### Reminder: Submission on BCS

- Please submit both the deployed Heroku link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

### Minimum Requirements

Attempt to complete homework assignment as described in instructions. If unable to complete certain portions, please pseudocode these portions to describe what remains to be completed. Adding a README.md as well as adding this homework to your portfolio are required as well and more information can be found below. **This assignment must be deployed.**

---

### Hosting on Heroku

Now that we have a backend to our applications, we use Heroku for hosting. Please note that while **Heroku is free**, it will request credit card information if you have more than 5 applications at a time or are adding a database.

Please see [Herokuâ€™s Account Verification Information](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification) for more details.

See the [Supplemental Heroku Deployment Guide with SQL](../../MySQLHerokuDeploymentProcess.pdf) for in-detail deployment instructions.

### Create a README.md

Add a `README.md` to your repository describing the project. Here are some resources for creating your `README.md`. Here are some resources to help you along the way:

- [About READMEs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/)

- [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
